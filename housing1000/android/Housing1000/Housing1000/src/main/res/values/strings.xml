    <string name="disclaimerText">
        Community Technology Alliance is a Partner Agency in the Help Management Information System. HMIS is a shared homeless and housing database system administered by The Santa Clara County Collaborative on Affordable Housing and Homelessness and Community Technology Alliance. HMIS can improve the services and programs for homeless and low-income households by allowing authorized staff at Partner Agencies to share client information and to follow trends and service patterns over time. HMIS operates over the Internet and uses many security protections to ensure confidentiality.\n\n
        Participation in the HMIS program is important to our community’s ability to provide you with the best services and housing possible. As you receive services, information will be collected about you, the services provided to you, and the outcomes these services help you to achieve.\n\n
        &#8226;Your name and other identifying information <b>will not</b> be shared with any agency not participating in the system. (Unless required to do so by law.)\n
        &#8226;Your name, gender, race, social security number and date of birth <b>may</b> be shared with Partner Agencies for identification purposes even if you elect not to share other relevant information.\n
        &#8226;Sensitive information such as diagnosis or treatment of mental health disorders, drug or alcohol disorders, HIV-AIDS, or domestic violence concerns, <b>will not</b> be shared between Partner Agencies without specific written consent.\n
        &#8226;A list of Partner Agencies is available on request.\n
        &#8226;Authorizing your information to be entered into the HMIS is voluntary.\n
        &#8226;Refusing to do so will not limit your access to shelter or services.\n\n
        I understand that I may cancel this authorization at any time by written request. I understand that this release is valid for three years from the date of my signature below.\n\n
